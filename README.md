# Revolutionizing-Liver-Care-Predicting-Liver-Cirrhosis-using-Advanced-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This project aims to predict liver cirrhosis at an early stage using advanced machine learning algorithms. By analyzing patient data, the model helps doctors detect liver damage early and provide better treatment, improving patient outcomes and saving lives.
